Last updated: 20.05.2023

### Introduction

At Hackitude, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit our website, and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.

### Information We Collect and How We Collect It

When using our website, we may collect several types of information from and about users of our website. We collect this data:

We also use Google Fonts on our website. Google Fonts is a service that allows us to use custom fonts on our website. When you access our site, your device sends a request to Google's servers to load the fonts. However, Google does not use this data to track you, and it aggregates and anonymizes the data.
